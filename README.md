# ICE-BA
## ICE-BA: Incremental, Consistent and Efficient Bundle Adjustment for Visual-Inertial SLAM  
We present ICE-BA, an incremental, consistent and efficient bundle adjustment for visual-inertial SLAM, which takes feature tracks, IMU measurements and optionally the loop constraints as input, performs in parallel both local BA over the sliding window and global BA over all keyframes, and outputs camera pose and updated map points for each frame in real-time. The main contributions include:  
- a new BA solver that leverages the incremental nature of SLAM measurements to achieve more than 10x efficiency compared to the state-of-the-arts.  
- a new relative marginalization algorithm that resolves the conflicts between sliding window marginalization bias and global loop closure constraints.  

Beside the backend solver, the library also provides an optic flow based frontend, which can be easily replaced by other more complicated frontends like ORB-SLAM2.  

The original implementation of our ICE-BA is at https://github.com/ZJUCVG/EIBA, which only performs global BA and does not support IMU input.

## 3. Build
cd ice-ba  
chmod +x build.sh  
./build.sh

## 4. Run
We provide examples to run ice-ba with [EuRoC dataset](https://projects.asl.ethz.ch/datasets/doku.php?id=kmavvisualinertialdatasets#downloads).  

### run ICE-BA stereo
Run ICE-BA in stereo mode. Please refer to scripts/run_ice_ba_stereo.sh for more details about how to run the example.  

### run ICE-BA monocular
Run ICE-BA in monocular mode. Please refer to scripts/run_ice_ba_mono.sh for more details about how to run the example.  

### run back-end only
Front-end results can be saved into files. Back-end only mode loads these files and runs backend only.  
Please refer to scripts/run_backend_only.sh for more details about how to run the example.
